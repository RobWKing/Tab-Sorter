This program is created for me to sort through my guitar tab PDFs based on different criteria. I have hundreds of tabs and sometimes want to play things I really like, at other times I want to challenge myself with something difficult or relax playing something easy, and other times I want to show off by playing things I can play very well, unrelated to their difficulty.

It is very simple, using just two classes, one for the main UI and the file creation logic (MainApplication) and one to handle the star buttons because they are a little more complicated than the others.

If I intended this to be used by others, I would probably create an .ini file to allow people to change the criteria it sorts files by, as well as allowing searching for other file types. I would also add more failsafes and feedback for the user in case of issues with file permissions or other errors.
